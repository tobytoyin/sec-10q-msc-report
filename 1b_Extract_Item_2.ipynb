Our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. Our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:', 'We have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (“OSATs”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (“ICs”), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots, autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on these customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor, electronics and industrial automation industries. Historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations.', 'The market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. A few customers drive significant demand for our test products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.', 'In the nine months ended September\\xa029, 2019, revenue in our test businesses has exceeded forecasts as a result of semiconductor test demand in China, early 5G test investments and strength in our System Test businesses. It is difficult to predict whether these positive trends will continue in 2020.', 'In the nine months ended September\\xa029, 2019, the revenue growth of our industrial automation business was below our forecast. We expect 2019 full year revenue growth of our industrial automation business to be under the low end of our long-term range of 30% to 40%.
